/*
how to use tryLock() with ReentrantLock in Java. Unlike lock(), tryLock() attempts to acquire the lock
immediately and returns true if successful, or false if the lock is already held by another thread, so your thread wonâ€™t block waiting.

What happens here?
Both threads try to get the lock without waiting.
If the lock is free, tryLock() returns true and the thread works inside the critical section.
If not, tryLock() returns false immediately, and the thread can do alternative work or retry later.
This avoids thread blocking, useful when you want to attempt a task only if the lock is free.
